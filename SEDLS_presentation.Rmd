## What we did

'Reproducible Research for Early Graduate Students' workshop series

- Included technical and non-technical sessions: 
  - Technical sessions: 
    - Version Control with Git/Github 
    - Reproducible Analysis and Documentation in RStudio/Rmarkdown 
  - Non-Technical sessions: 
    - Organize for Transparent and Reproducible Research 
    - Sharing Your Data for Transparent and Reproducible Research

::: {.notes}
UVA Library's Research Data Services (RDS) launched a new workshop
series called "Reproducible Research for Early Graduate Students". The
four workshops in the series focused on both technical and non-technical
tools for reproducible research. The overall concept was to enable
researchers to improve data use and re-use for collaborators and
themselves, use available technical tools to create reproducible
workflows, and more easily communicate and disseminate findings and
data. The target audience are students in STEM departments.

Our technical sessions covered tools and workflow on topics such as
version control with Git and Github and R Studio/R Markdown tools.

Our non-technical sessions covered file and metadata organization and
data sharing.
:::

## How we did it

-   Launched mini-series as part of ongoing workshop series
-   Leveraged our staff's skillset
-   Some new, some old sessions

::: {.notes}
Each semester, our Research Data Services group teaches a workshop
series, taught by our staff as well as collaborators in other groups
around the university. We offer sessions and trainings on technical
topics of interest to our user community. We offer several mini-series
within our workshop series such as this one and others including both
the R and Python languages, Qualitative Research, Tableau, etc.

Our offerings are determined by a combination of demand by our
constituents and skills of our team members. Some of the sessions in our
reproducibility series (non-technical and conceptual sessions), one was
an existing workshop (version control), and one was a mashup of old and
new content (RStudio/RMarkdown)

## How you can do it

-   Take our stuff!
-   Re-brand existing workshops/classes at your library
-   Look for partners at your institution to partner with
-   You don't need to be an expert

::: {.notes}
Our data, code, and more information is openly available. Take our
stuff! We have put open licenses on all the materials we post. There is
no need to create all the materials from scratch. The current version
control workshop is a combination of previous workshop materials plus
online content that someone else created.

Look around for existing workshops at your library to market or re-brand
to fit into a reproducibility theme. Are you already doing things you
could use for this purpose?

Look for partners to collaborate on a series of reproducibility. One
person does not and should not have to do it all! We partner with other
library colleagues and other departments entirely at the University to
offer guest-taught workshops in our series. For example, we collaborate
with people like Sherry, who is not a part of Research Data Services and
also our Health Sciences library and Research Computing groups to offer
a variety of workshops.

We all have various levels of technical expertise. Some technical
experience is definitely helpful but you don't have to be a data
scientist to teach in this area. Half of our series was conceptual. I
(Jenn) considers herself a beginner in R, but that is enough to "see"
the value in tools or features that might be overlooked or not formally
taught. Not all these tools require a strong statistical/data
science/programming background in order to teach them.

## Feedback and Assessment

-   Track attendance
-   Post workshop follow up

::: {.notes}
Graduate students are our target audience and most common attendee type.
But we also have a number of post-docs, faculty, staff, undergraduates,
and community members.

In the pre-covid times we held in-person workshops and attendance has
traditionally been high. During the pandemic last year, we taught our
workshops online with good attendance. This semester, the university is
pushing hard to go "back to normal" so we have been offering our
workshops in person again. Attendance has been low and we feel it is
probably just too soon for the full in-person workshops again.
:::

## Looking Forward

-   What to include here?

::: {.notes}
I (Jenn) would consider trying to take this to specific departments,
reach out to DGS's (director of graduate studies) perhaps? Find seminar
series where this might fit in? PhD+ series. Find Reproducibility
champions who want their grad students to learn these concepts?
