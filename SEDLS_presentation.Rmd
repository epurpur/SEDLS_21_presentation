Welcome to our talk today about how we implemented a Reproducibility workshop series at UVA Library.  I am Jennifer Huck; I'm the Data Librarian and Acting Associate Director of Research Data Services at UVA Library.  I am joined by Sherry Lake, the Scholarly Repository Librarian, and Erich Purpur, a Science and Engineering Research Librarian. 

Here is a little about the University of Virginia:

- R1 university.
- There are about 23,000 students and there are 12 Schools.
- Only the School of Data Science has a policy for open access and open data

And some context for UVA Library:

- Our team members come from Scholarly Communications and Research Data Services & Social, Natural, and Engineering Sciences, which are teams from different units in the library.
- Research Data Services has a long-running workshop series on tools for quantitative and qualitative data analysis.
- One thing to point out: It is very rare for library staff to teach for-credit courses at UVA. Teaching a within a workshop series like this is one of our best chances for instruction.

## What We Did

 A **new workshop series**: 'Reproducible Research for Early Graduate Students' 

Included 2 **technical** and 2 **non-technical** sessions: 

- Technical sessions: tools and workflows
- Non-Technical sessions: conceptual instruction on organization and data sharing

::: {.notes}
JENN: 3 min (spend 2 minutes here)

- In Spring 2021, UVA Library's Research Data Services (RDS) launched a 
**new workshop series** called "Reproducible Research for Early Graduate Students." 
- The overall concept was to enable
researchers to improve data use and re-use for collaborators and
themselves; to use available technical tools to create reproducible
workflows; and to communicate and disseminate findings and
data. The initial target audience was early graduate students in STEM departments.
- The
four workshops in the series focused on both **technical** and **non-technical tools for reproducible research**. 
  - Our technical sessions covered tools and workflows, and 
  - Our non-technical sessions covered file and metadata organization and data sharing.

:::

## How We Did It

- We launched it as a **standalone mini-series** as part of Research Data Service's ongoing workshop series
- We leveraged a relatively **varied skillset** among library staff to present these sessions.
- Sessions were a mix of **old** and **new** workshop content
- Outreach: Research Data Services Newsletter, reaching out to communications directors at various schools
- Virtual (Spring 2021) and In Person (Fall 2021)

::: {.notes}
JENN: 4 min (spend 1 min here)

- Each semester, our Research Data Services team presents an extensive suite of workshops
 taught by our staff, as well as collaborators from other units throughout the university. We offer training on technical tools, such as R, Python, Tableau, and Dedoose.  We launched our Reproducibility series as a **standalone mini-series** within that workshop environment. 
- We are fortunate to have a lot of staff at our library with some facility in data.  We were able to pull in  librarians with **varied skillsets**. 
- Our sessions were a mix of old and new workshop content.  Of the sessions in our
reproducibility series, one was
an existing workshop, one was a mashup of old and
new content, and two were brand new. 
- As for Outreach, we advertised the sessions in our Research Data Services Newsletter which goes out to interested readers at UVA, and we also reached out directly to communications directors at various schools who then  send info to their students.
- We had two presentation formats.  This Spring, we presented virtually via Zoom, and this Fall we presented in person.

## Organizing Files and Metadata for Transparent & Reproducible Research

- Project organization: demonstrated & discussed the concepts
  - Organizing files: directory (grouping) structure
  - Documentation (e.g., READMEs)
  - File Naming 
  
::: {.notes}
SHERRY: 5 min (spend 1 min here)

The workshop series started with the non-technical workshop: Organizing Files 
and Metadata for Transparent & Reproducible Research

In this workshop, participants were instructed on fundamental approaches on 
creating a research compendium, which is the foundation of transparent and 
reproducible research. 

Participants learned what kinds of documents and materials they should create
and preserve; what type of information the documents should contain; and how 
they should be formatted and organized. Topics for this workshop included 
organizing raw data (files), data analysis, documentation, scripts, metadata, 
readme files, project organization, and naming conventions. 

The examples were based in R, but no programming experience or experience 
with R was required, as the information learned in the workshop could be 
applied to any quantitative programming environment.

## Sharing Your Data for Transparent and Reproducible Research

- Why share 
- Where to share
  - Picking a repo
  - Introducing FAIR principles 
- What to share
- How to Share 
- List of steps for sharing

::: {.notes}
SHERRY: 6 min (spend 1 min here)

The last workshop in the series was Sharing Your Data for Transparent and 
Reproducible Research

This workshop covered tools and resources on 
sharing research during a project and at the completion of a project. 
Participants learned why, how and where to share and disseminate 
research results per funder and journal requirements. Topics covered
included introducing the Open Science Framework (OSF), making your 
research data FAIR, locating repositories to disseminate research, 
and licensing data.

This workshop was broken down into why, where, what, how, when to share data.

Starting with an overview of why share, which included among other reasons,
the need to share for transparency. 

It included - Where to share
   How to pick a repository
   By Introducing FAIR principles - as way to select a repo & talk about 
   "re-use" & how it relates to transparency.

What to share - covered what can't be shared & included a list of UVa's 
policies related to data collection and data protection.

How to Share, including licenses - keying in on the purpose of sharing 
for Transparent and reproducible research (for our workshops at least)

This is where I related "Sharing" to a Data Management or Sharing Plan. Sharing
  Starts w/ these - key Data Management practices, those practices from the
  earlier workshop on organization and version control.

The Sharing session concluded w/ a summation list of steps for sharing.

# Workshop Details: <BR />Technical Sessions

## Version Control with Git and GitHub

- Learn about version control
- Install git and make Github account
- Common workflow scenarios
  - local changes
  - push to remote repository
  - branching/collaboration

::: {.notes}
ERICH: 7 min (spend 1 min here)

I taught the workshop on version control using Git and Github. Version control is used to manage code development individually or in a team setting. In the context of this presentation, version control is really important because it is basically a complete record of everything that has happened in your code base since the beginning of a project. We first made sure that everyone was up and running with Git and also a github account. Then we walked through common workflow scenarios. We first tracked our code changes locally. Then we pushed the to the remote Github repository. Later, we walked through collaboration scenarios using branches and pull requests. 
:::

## RStudio and R Markdown

- Review RStudio Projects to create a project-oriented workflow in R. 
- Overview of R Markdown for literate programming, including new features of Visual R Markdown. 

::: {.notes}
JENN: 8 min (spend 1 min here)

For this session we reviewed RStudio Projects to create a project-oriented workflow in R. We also provided an overview of R Markdown for literate programming.  This highlighted the new features of Visual R Markdown, which makes using R Markdown much easier and has some great new features like connecting RStudio to Zotero.

## How You Can Do It

-   Look for partners at your institution to partner with
-   You don't need to be an expert - skills can be emerging
-   Re-brand existing workshops and classes at your library
-   Take our stuff!

::: {.notes}
JENN: 10 min (spend 2 min here)

Here are some takeaways:

- Look for partners to collaborate on a series of reproducibility. One
person does not and should not have to do it all! We partner with other
library colleagues outside of Research Data Services and units outside of the library. For example, we collaborate
with librarians like Sherry, who is not a part of Research Data Services and
also with our Health Sciences Library and Research Computing colleagues to offer
a wide variety of workshops.
- We all have various levels of technical expertise. Some technical
experience is definitely helpful but you don't have to be a data
scientist to teach in this area. I
consider my skills in R to be "emerging," but I found that that was enough for me to "see"
the value in tools (especially in RStudio) or concepts that might be overlooked or not formally
taught. Not all these tools require a strong statistical, data
science, or programming background in order to teach them.
- Look around for existing workshops at your library to market or re-brand
to fit into a Reproducibility theme. Are you already doing things you
could use for this purpose? Sherry will expand on this idea in the next slide.
- Finally, all of our workshop material is openly available. Take our
stuff! There is
no need to create all the materials from scratch. Note that the version
control workshop is a combination of previous workshop materials plus
online content that created externally.

## Transform Data Management Workshops

<div class="centered">
![[@jones_open_2018]

</div>

::: {.notes}

SHERRY: 12 min (spend 2 min here)

I want to spend a couple of minutes making a link from typical data management and sharing workshops to transparency and reproducibility.

Doing research for transparency and managing data (data management) [and FAIR] are overlapping, but distinct concepts each emphasizing different aspects of handling and sharing research data.

Knowing about these "differences" (and strengths) can help librarians promote good research practices. Sharing - promote access & reuse, DM is basis from the start of a project in order for sharing to be meaningful.

Research Data Management (RDM): is not a goal in itself, but a set of 
practices to handle information collected and created during research. 
RDM is the compilation of many small practices that make your data easier 
to find, easier to understand, less likely to be lost, and more likely to 
be usable during a project or ten years later. 

FAIR principles advocate for increased findability, accessibility, 
interoperability and reusability of research data and scholarly digital 
objects more generally. 

FAIR and transparency are "noble" aspirations & useful way to engage researchers and encourage good data practices from the outset. FAIR/Reproducibility are more catchy concepts to engage researchers in DM.

FAIR and transparency extends DM - data & research is not just managed but are FAIR and can be understood, reproducible. Data that is not "managed" cannot be successfully shared/re-used (FAIR).

Thus... we can’t forget data management - 
DM is needed before data can be FAIR and shared - it enables data to be created and used in a way that increases transparency helps in sharing and reuse.
BUT.... maybe by using the more appealing language of FAIR and organizing research, we can engage researchers in data management too. Note: Jenn did not use the phrase "Data Management" at all in her workshop/title or presentation, BUT file organization, file naming, documentation are all basic DM 101.

FAIR and transparency both focus on data sharing, ensuring content is made available 
in ways that promote access and reuse. Data management by contrast is about 
the stewardship of data from the point of conception onwards. It makes no 
assumptions about access, but is essential if data are to be meaningful 
to others.

The way we presented the concepts of reproducible research & sneaking in DM concepts (without calling them that) and FAIR practices is a useful way to engage researchers and encourage good 
data practices from the outset. It might open conversations with researchers 
and funders in ways that dull old data management never did.


Research Data Management is the foundation for sharing. Managing and sharing research data are not a high priority for researchers - choosing the right "terminology" (concepts of FAIR, organization, sharing, transparency, reproducibility) can help in the up-take of best practices for managing and sharing.

## Feedback and Assessment

-   Track attendance
-   Post workshop follow up

::: {.notes}
ERICH: 14 min (spend 1 min here)

Graduate students are our target audience and most common attendee type but we had a lot of attendees who were post-docs and research scientists, which we did not expect.

We also have a number of post-docs, faculty, staff, undergraduates,
and community members.

In the pre-covid times we held in-person workshops and attendance has
traditionally been high. During the pandemic last year, we taught our
workshops online with good attendance. This semester, the university is
pushing hard to go "back to normal" so we have been offering our
workshops in person again. Attendance has been low and we feel it is
probably just too soon for the full in-person workshops again.
:::

## Looking Forward

Some ideas:

- Do specific outreach to departments on this kind of training
- Find a seminar series that this could fit into 
- Find "reproducibility champions" who want their grad student to learn these concepts

::: {.notes}
JENN: 15 min (spend 1 min here)

- We would consider trying to take this to specific departments, by 
reaching out to Directors of Graduate Studies.
- We might also find other seminar series at UVA where this might fit into.
- A final idea is to find Reproducibility champions who want their grad students to learn these concepts, and come teach a lab directly.
