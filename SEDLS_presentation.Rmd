  <div>
  
    - 'Reproducible Research for Early Graduate Students' workshop series
    - Included technical and non-technical sessions
    
    Technical sessions:
      - Version Control with Git/Github
      - Reproducible Analysis and Documentation in RStudo/Rmarkdown
    
    Non-Technical sessions:
      - Organize for Transparent and Reproducible Research
      - Sharing Your Data for Transparent and Reproducible Research
  </div>

::: {.notes}
UVA Library's Research Data Services (RDS) launched a new workshop series called "Reproducible Research for Early Graduate Students". The four workshops in the series focused on both technical and non-technical tools for reproducible research. The overall concept was to enable researchers to improve data use and re-use for collaborators and themselves, use available technical tools to create reproducible workflows, and more easily communicate and disseminate findings and data. The target audience are students in STEM departments. 

Our technical sessions covered tools and workflow on topics such as version control with Git and Github and R Studio/R Markdown tools.

Our non-technical sessions covered file and metadata organization and data sharing.

  <h1 style="font-size:75px">How we did it</h1>
  <div>
  
    - Launched mini-series as part of ongoing workshop series
  
    - Leveraged our staff's skillset
  
    - Some new, some old sessions
    
  </div>
</center>

::: {.notes}
Each semester, our Research Data Services group teaches a workshop series, taught by our staff as well as collaborators in other groups around the university. We offer sessions and trainings on technical topics of interest to our user community. We offer several mini-series within our workshop series such as this one and others including both the R and Python languages, Qualitative Research, Tableau, etc. 

Our offerings are determined by a combination of demand by our constituents and skills of our team members. Some of the sessions in our reproducibility series (non-technical and conceptual sessions), one was an existing workshop (version control), and one was a mashup of old and new content (RStudio/RMarkdown)

  <h1 style="font-size:75px">How you can do it</h1>
  <div>
  
  
  
    - Take our stuff!
    
    - Re-brand existing workshops/classes at your library
    
    - Look for partners at your institution to partner with
    
    - You don't need to be an expert
    
  </div>
</center>

::: {.notes}
Our data, code, and more information is openly available. Take our stuff! We have put open licenses on all the materials we post. There is no need to create all the materials from scratch. The current version control workshop is a combination of previous workshop materials plus online content that someone else created. 

Look around for existing workshops at your library to market or re-brand to fit into a reproducibility theme. Are you already doing things you could use for this purpose?

Look for partners to collaborate on a series of reproducibility. One person does not and should not have to do it all! We partner with other library colleagues and other departments entirely at the University to offer guest-taught workshops in our series. For example, we collaborate with people like Sherry, who is not a part of Research Data Services and also our Health Sciences library and Research Computing groups to offer a variety of workshops.

We all have various levels of technical expertise. Some technical experience is definitely helpful but you don't have to be a data scientist to teach in this area. Half of our series was conceptual. I (Jenn) considers herself a beginner in R, but that is enough to "see" the value in tools or features that might be overlooked or not formally taught. Not all these tools require a strong statistical/data science/programming background in order to teach them.

Graduate students are our target audience and most common attendee type. But we also have a number of post-docs, faculty, staff, undergraduates, and community members. 

In the pre-covid times we held in-person workshops and attendance has traditionally been high. During the pandemic last year, we taught our workshops online with good attendance. This semester, the university is pushing hard to go "back to normal" so we have been offering our workshops in person again. Attendance has been low and we feel it is probably just too soon for the full in-person workshops again.

    What to include here?
  </div>
</center>

::: {.notes}
I (Jenn) would consider trying to take this to specific departments, reach out to DGSâ€™s (director of graduate studies) perhaps?  Find seminar series where this might fit in?  PhD+ series.  Find Reproducibility champions who want their grad students to learn these concepts?
