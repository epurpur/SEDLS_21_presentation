## What We Did

 A **new workshop series**: 'Reproducible Research for Early Graduate Students' 

Included 2 **technical** and 2 **non-technical** sessions: 

- Technical sessions: 
  - Version Control with Git and GitHub 
  - Reproducible Analysis and Documentation in RStudio/Rmarkdown 
- Non-Technical sessions: 
  - Organize for Transparent and Reproducible Research 
  - Sharing Your Data for Transparent and Reproducible Research

::: {.notes}

- In Spring 2021, UVA Library's Research Data Services (RDS) launched a 
**new workshop series** called "Reproducible Research for Early Graduate Students." The
four workshops in the series focused on both **technical** and **non-technical tools for reproducible research**. 
- The overall concept was to enable
researchers to improve data use and re-use for collaborators and
themselves, use available technical tools to create reproducible
workflows, and more easily communicate and disseminate findings and
data. The target audience are students in STEM departments.
- Our technical sessions covered tools and workflows. 
- Our non-technical sessions covered file and metadata organization and data sharing.

:::

## How We Did It

- We launched it as a **standalone mini-series** as part of Research Data Service's ongoing workshop series
- We leveraged a relatively **varied skillset** among library staff to present these sessions. These skills were both **existing** and **emerging**.
- Sessions were a mix of **old** and **new** workshop content
- Outreach: Research Data Services Newsletter, reaching out to communications directors at various schools
- Virtual (Spring 2021) and In Person (Fall 2021)

Each semester, our Research Data Services group teaches a workshop
series, taught by our staff as well as collaborators in other groups
around the university. We offer sessions and training on technical
topics of interest to our user community. There are several mini-series
within our workshop series such as those covering R, Python, Qualitative Research, and Tableau.

We are fortunate to have a lot of staff at our library with some facility in data.  We were able to pull in various librarians with different skills.

Our offerings are determined by a combination of demand by our
constituents and skills of our team members. Of the sessions in our
reproducibility series (non-technical and conceptual sessions), one was
an existing workshop (version control), and one was a mashup of old and
new content (RStudio/R Markdown)

## Organizing Files and Metadata for Transparent & Reproducible Research

- Project organization: demonstrated & discussed the concepts
  - Organizing files: directory (grouping) structure
  - Documentation (e.g., READMEs)
  - File Naming 
  
::: {.notes}
SHERRY: 5 min (spend 1 min here)

The workshop series started with the non-technical workshop: Organizing Files 
and Metadata for Transparent & Reproducible Research

In this workshop, participants were instructed on fundamental approaches on 
creating a research compendium, which is the foundation of transparent and 
reproducible research. 

Participants learned what kinds of documents and materials they should create
and preserve; what type of information the documents should contain; and how 
they should be formatted and organized. Topics for this workshop included 
organizing raw data (files), data analysis, documentation, scripts, metadata, 
readme files, project organization, and naming conventions. 

The examples were based in R, but no programming experience or experience 
with R was required, as the information learned in the workshop could be 
applied to any quantitative programming environment.

## Sharing Your Data for Transparent and Reproducible Research

- Why share 
- Where to share
  - Picking a repo
  - Introducing FAIR principles 
- What to share
- How to Share 
- List of steps for sharing

::: {.notes}
SHERRY: 6 min (spend 1 min here)

The last workshop in the series was Sharing Your Data for Transparent and 
Reproducible Research

This workshop covered tools and resources on 
sharing research during a project and at the completion of a project. 
Participants learned why, how and where to share and disseminate 
research results per funder and journal requirements. Topics covered
included introducing the Open Science Framework (OSF), making your 
research data FAIR, locating repositories to disseminate research, 
and licensing data.

This workshop was broken down into why, where, what, how, when to share data.

Starting with an overview of why share, which included among other reasons,
the need to share for transparency. 

It included - Where to share
   How to pick a repository
   By Introducing FAIR principles - as way to select a repo & talk about 
   "re-use" & how it relates to transparency.

What to share - covered what can't be shared & included a list of UVa's 
policies related to data collection and data protection.

How to Share, including licenses - keying in on the purpose of sharing 
for Transparent and reproducible research (for our workshops at least)

This is where I related "Sharing" to a Data Management or Sharing Plan. Sharing
  Starts w/ these - key Data Management practices, those practices from the
  earlier workshop on organization and version control.

The Sharing session concluded w/ a summation list of steps for sharing.

# Workshop Details: <BR />Technical Sessions

## Version Control with Git and GitHub

- Learn about version control
- Install git and make Github account
- Common workflow scenarios
  - local changes
  - push to remote repository
  - branching/collaboration

::: {.notes}
ERICH: 7 min (spend 1 min here)

I taught the workshop on version control using Git and Github. Version control is used to manage code development individually or in a team setting. In the context of this presentation, version control is really important because it is basically a complete record of everything that has happened in your code base since the beginning of a project. We first made sure that everyone was up and running with Git and also a github account. Then we walked through common workflow scenarios. We first tracked our code changes locally. Then we pushed the to the remote Github repository. Later, we walked through collaboration scenarios using branches and pull requests. 
:::

## RStudio and R Markdown

- Review RStudio Projects to create a project-oriented workflow in R. 
- Overview of R Markdown for literate programming. 
  - Include new features of Visual R Markdown, such as citations and technical writing.

## How You Can Do It

-   Look for partners at your institution to partner with
-   You don't need to be an expert
-   Re-brand existing workshops and classes at your library
-   Take our stuff!

::: {.notes}
JENN: 10 min (spend 2 min here)

Look for partners to collaborate on a series of reproducibility. One
person does not and should not have to do it all! We partner with other
library colleagues and other departments entirely at the University to
offer guest-taught workshops in our series. For example, we collaborate
with people like Sherry, who is not a part of Research Data Services and
also our Health Sciences library and Research Computing groups to offer
a variety of workshops.

We all have various levels of technical expertise. Some technical
experience is definitely helpful but you don't have to be a data
scientist to teach in this area. Half of our series was conceptual. I
(Jenn) considers herself a beginner in R, but that is enough to "see"
the value in tools or features that might be overlooked or not formally
taught. Not all these tools require a strong statistical/data
science/programming background in order to teach them.

Look around for existing workshops at your library to market or re-brand
to fit into a reproducibility theme. Are you already doing things you
could use for this purpose?

Sherry will expand on this idea in the next slide.

Our data, code, and more information is openly available. Take our
stuff! We have put open licenses on all the materials we post. There is
no need to create all the materials from scratch. The current version
control workshop is a combination of previous workshop materials plus
online content that someone else created.

## Transform Data Management Workshops

SHERRY WILL Work on the wording here.

SHERRY: 12 min (spend 2 min here)
But how does FAIR intersect or displace the conversation of Data Management 
and Data Management Plans for Sharing data
Little to no emphasis on "re-use", so what good is sharing??

Research Data Management (RDM): is not a goal in itself, but a set of 
practices to handle information collected and created during research. 
RDM is the compilation of many small practices that make your data easier 
to find, easier to understand, less likely to be lost, and more likely to 
be usable during a project or ten years later

FAIR principles advocate for increased findability, accessibility, 
interoperability and reusability of research data and scholarly digital 
objects more generally. Central to the concept of FAIR is its application 
‘to both human-driven and machine-driven activities’

But we can’t forget data management - 
RDM is the bedrock: if data have not been properly created and managed 
during the early stages of research, it will be very difficult to make them 
FAIR or open. Data management enables FAIR and open sharing, while the 
principles of FAIR and open can act as inspiration to engage researchers 
in effective data management. By using the more appealing language of FAIR 
and open, we can engage people in data management too.

Open data, FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) and 
research data management (RDM) are three overlapping but distinct concepts,
each emphasizing different aspects of handling and sharing research data. 
They have different strengths in terms of informing and influencing how
research data is treated

FAIR and open both focus on data sharing, ensuring content is made available 
in ways that promote access and reuse. Data management by contrast is about 
the stewardship of data from the point of conception onwards. It makes no 
assumptions about access, but is essential if data are to be meaningful 
to others.

concepts of FAIR - a useful way to engage researchers and encourage good 
data practices from the outset. It can open conversations with researchers 
and funders in ways that dull old data management never did.

Open Data practice of making underlying research data publicly available, 
accessible and reusable with minimal restrictions. open data has increasingly
become an expectation of funders and policymakers, often framed by the maxim 
of ‘as open as possible, as closed as necessary’.


RDM, FAIR and open are all important in their own right and should be viewed
as complementary yet distinct.

## Feedback and Assessment

-   Track attendance
-   Post workshop follow up

::: {.notes}
ERICH: 14 min (spend 1 min here)

Graduate students are our target audience and most common attendee type.
But we also have a number of post-docs, faculty, staff, undergraduates,
and community members.

In the pre-covid times we held in-person workshops and attendance has
traditionally been high. During the pandemic last year, we taught our
workshops online with good attendance. This semester, the university is
pushing hard to go "back to normal" so we have been offering our
workshops in person again. Attendance has been low and we feel it is
probably just too soon for the full in-person workshops again.
:::

## Looking Forward

Some ideas:

- Do specific outreach to departments on this kind of training
- Find a seminar series that this could fit into 
- Find "reproducibility champions" who want their grad student to learn these concepts

::: {.notes}
JENN: 15 min (spend 1 min here)

We would consider trying to take this to specific departments,
reach out to DGS's (director of graduate studies) perhaps? 

Find seminar series where this might fit in? PhD+ series. 

Find Reproducibility champions who want their grad students to learn these concepts?
