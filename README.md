## Abstract

UVA Library Research Data Services (RDS) launched a new workshop series called “Reproducible Research for Early Graduate Students.” The four workshops in the series focused on technical and non-technical tools for reproducible research. The overall concept was to enable researchers to improve data use and re-use for collaborators and themselves, use available technical tools to create reproducible workflows, and more easily communicate and disseminate findings and data. Technical sessions covered version control and R Studio tools; non-technical sessions covered file and metadata organization and data sharing. We launched it as a standalone mini-series within our ongoing data workshop series. We leveraged a relatively varied skillset among library staff to present these sessions. Data, code, and more information is openly available. While graduate students were the most common attendee type, we had a significant number of post-docs and research staff attend our sessions. Feedback collected via follow-up surveys was generally positive prompting us to offer the series again this Fall. We believe our efforts are reproducible at other institutions in a similar way or at a smaller or larger scale and will discuss how.
